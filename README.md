# OVERVIEW

For this project, our task was to analyze local and global temperature data and compare temperature trends between our city and the world. We are to create visualization and prepate a report that would describe the similarites and differences between the global temperature trends to that of the closest large city that we live in. As part of this project, we were to extract data from the database using SQL and export it as a csv file. I then used Python to open the csv file and created line charts to analyze the temperature trends.
